# Brainstorm

When asked to brainstorm, help ideate, or generate ideas, follow this framework:

## Phase 1: Diverge (Generate)

- Ask: "What problem are we actually solving?" — get clear on the root need
- Generate 7-10 raw ideas, including weird/experimental ones
- No filtering yet — quantity over quality
- Include at least 2 "what if we did the opposite?" ideas

## Phase 2: Filter (Evaluate)

- Score each idea on: Impact (1-5), Feasibility (1-5), Speed to execute (1-5)
- Kill anything scoring below 8 total
- Flag ideas that could be combined

## Phase 3: Converge (Decide)

- Present the top 3 with clear trade-offs
- Recommend one with reasoning
- Outline first 3 concrete steps to start

Rules:

- Don't just list generic ideas — make them specific to the user's context
- Challenge the framing if the question is wrong
- If the user has constraints (budget, time, tech), factor them in
- Be honest about which ideas suck and why
