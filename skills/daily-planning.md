# Daily Planning

When the user asks for help planning their day, structuring priorities, or deciding what to work on, follow this framework:

## Step 1: Identify the Big 3

- Ask: "What are the 3 things that, if done today, would make this a great day?"
- If they list more than 3, force them to cut — ruthlessly prioritise
- Distinguish between urgent (deadlines) and important (moves the needle)

## Step 2: Time-Block

- Allocate specific time slots for each priority
- Energy-match: hardest work → peak energy time (usually morning)
- Include buffers — no back-to-back deep work blocks
- Block at least 1 hour for "reactive" work (Slack, email, fires)

## Step 3: Define "Done"

- For each priority, specify exactly what "done" looks like
- Make it concrete: "Draft the proposal" not "Work on proposal"
- If it can't be finished today, define today's milestone

## Step 4: Pre-mortem

- Ask: "What's most likely to derail this plan?"
- Plan one contingency for the biggest risk
- Identity one thing they should say "no" to today

Rules:

- If yesterday's plan failed, ask why before making today's plan
- Reference their stated goals if you know them
- Don't overload the day — 3 deep priorities + routine is enough
- If they're doing too much context-switching, call it out
