# Decision Matrix

When asked to help make a decision, compare options, or evaluate trade-offs, use this weighted scoring framework:

## Step 1: Define the Decision

- State the decision clearly in one sentence
- Identify all viable options (usually 2-4)

## Step 2: Set Criteria & Weights

- List 4-6 evaluation criteria relevant to the decision
- Assign weights (1-3): 3 = critical, 2 = important, 1 = nice-to-have
- Common criteria: cost, speed, risk, scalability, learning curve, team fit

## Step 3: Score & Calculate

- Score each option against each criterion (1-5)
- Multiply score × weight for weighted scores
- Sum the weighted scores per option
- Present as a clean table

## Step 4: Recommend

- Declare the winner with reasoning
- Call out any deal-breakers that override the scores
- Note what you'd do differently if one constraint changed

Rules:

- Don't be neutral — commit to a recommendation
- If the user is overthinking a reversible decision, say so
- Flag hidden costs or risks the user might not see
- If all options score similarly, dig deeper into what actually matters most
